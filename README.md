# ivy-list
A To Do List web application built using Django and Vue. It is meant to encourage users to use the Ivy Lee method.

I built this project to learn how to use the Vue CLI tool to build a front end, and how to integrate it with an API powered by Django

# The Ivy Lee method
The Ivy Lee method is a way of structuring a to do list in order to maximise productivity. At the end of each day (or right at the start of the next) you should write down 6 things you would like to accomplish the next day. You may not write any more than 6 items. You then prioritise the list from the most important to the least important. At the start of the next day, you start working on the first item of the list, and you cannot move on until it is finished and checked off your list. You then move on to the next item and so on until you finish the list or reach the end of the day. Any items not completed move onto the next days list and you add more items until you have 6 things to work on the next day. 

This method is meant to help you prioritise what needs to be done the next day, and stops you from getting distracted from trying to multi task.
